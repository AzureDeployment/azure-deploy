### Create Deployment Workstation
In order to make this deployment experience as seemless and expidited as possible, we will be leveraging Windows 10 Virtual Machine in your Azure Subscription. This allows us to create a workstation that has the tools needed to complete the deployment with minimal interruptions. The complete install of the Windows 10 Workstation is documented in this library so that you can setup and configure your own workstation at a later date.
