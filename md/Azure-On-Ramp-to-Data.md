# Azure On Ramp to Data
This Knowledge Base (KB) and git repo provides information, ARM templates and PowerShell scripts to facilitate the implementation of the Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**) based on the guidance provided by Microsoft and the [Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF). The focus of this section of the KB is specifically targeted at Data Services Engineers and Architects responsible for planning, migrating, securing, governing, managing and developing on the [Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**)](Azure-On-Ramp-to-Data/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md)

The [Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**)](Azure-On-Ramp-to-Data/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md) is built on top of the [Azure On-Ramp Landing Zone](Azure-On-Ramp.md). The [Azure Data & Analytics Platform (**ADAP**)](Azure-On-Ramp-to-Data/Reference/Azure-Data-and-Analytics-Platform.md) will take a dependency on the [Core Landing Zone Configuration](Home/Core-Landing-Zone-Configuration-Model.md).

This KB will align purposely to the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF) implementation phases. The intent is to leverage the guidance in the CAF, with specific and concrete implementation patterns for the Azure Data & Analytics Platform (ADAP).

The most important thing that you can do is familiarize yourself with the [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF). We will leverage the CAF as a team and continue to push its boundaries. Where there are gaps we will lean on Microsoft to provide clarity. 

## Getting Started
With a strong understanding of [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (**CAF**)](https://aka.ms/CAF), it now time to identify and define the "**fundamentals**" of how we at Quisitive will implement the prescriptive guidance in the [**CAF**](https://aka.ms/CAF).
